This folder contains all Turk’s Head templates where the number of leads is greater than the number of bights. These are the patterns not covered by full recipes in the main text but still useful for practice and exploration.

Each PDF is ready to print. Simply place it on your pinboard and trace the cord directly over the template:

Solid line = go over

Gap in the line = go under

Follow the path once around to complete the first pass, then tighten as usual.

These templates follow the same A4 layout as the others in this book and will print correctly on US Letter or Legal using “Fit to page.”
