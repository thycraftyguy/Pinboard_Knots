Printing note:
These templates were created on A4 paper, but they print flawlessly on US Letter or Legal. Just select “Fit to page” (or your printer’s equivalent) and the circular geometry will scale uniformly. The proportions remain exact, and the additional white space on US formats has no effect on accuracy.
